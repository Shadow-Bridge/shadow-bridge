v.0.0.8:
	Ghouls no longer respawn at the same exact coordinates. 
		Upon being killed, they respawn in random locations outside the screen.
		Current range: 128 to 1024 pixels.
	Added a health mechanic. If a ghoul touches you, your health decreases (albeit too quickly right now).
		Reaching 0 health closes the game. Not the best idea, I know.
	Added mana/energy. Attacks now consume it, but it slowly regenerates.
		Current cost is 15 mana, and having less than that disables your attacks.
		This is a temporary use, until skills are implemented.

v0.0.8b:
	Fixed the attack hitbox of the ghouls.
	Removed a debugging message.

v0.0.8c:
	Added a missing library.
v0.0.9:
	Fixed the status bar.
	Made the game fullscreen and fixed some scaling issues.
v0.0.9b:
	Fixed positioning issues on lower resolutions, where characters were hovering in mid-air.
v0.0.9c:
	Fixed so fucking many scaling issues. I am exhausted.
v0.0.10:
	Added health and mana counters.
